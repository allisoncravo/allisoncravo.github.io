    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>He was born to Mexican parents and grew up with his three older siblings in Hobart, Indiana. Both of his parents had to work multiple jobs to support their family. He danced ballet folklorico when he was a child and was part of the Catholic church choir. His parents bought him a guitar when he was 12, but it was an electric guitar with no amp. So, he traded it in for an acoustic guitar. He learned and practiced playing through YouTube and also with the help of his uncle. </p>
